#Website Issues

Figuring out the website was pretty easy, I based my code off of your set-up from in-class, and just added a gif.

I had to use this site to find out how to add a gif in html:
https://www-it.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/courses/maten/module1/activity32.html

I had initially tried it by inserting a URL, but remembered you said assets have to be in the folder to pull from, so I saved and uploaded my gif.

Thanks!
