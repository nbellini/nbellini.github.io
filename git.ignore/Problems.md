# Website Issues

Okay so it was pretty fun and chaotic to work together using branches this way.

We had difficulties non-stop just from going over how to clone my repository, to setting up our branches, to figuring out especially the flow of merge requests to the main.

One thing that I had to figure out as the owner of the repository was that I had to approve merge requests, including going in and removing coding errors to allow the merge. However, once I got the hang of it - about 40 minutes in - we were able to get the ball rolling.

Using a css sheet from W3schools, we were able to get a very basic text format, and used that as one of our assets. We divided and conquered while I was working on the css sheet and figuring out merging with Chris, Raja and Andrew were able to create our audio and visual files for our assets.

By the end, we did get into a bit of a scramble where Andrew had to insert his paragraph directly through the main since we didn't have enough time to go through his branch.

Additionally, I've been having trouble getting a picture to load and am currently still working on it. We simply ran out of time, but the issue was just getting the correct source link to a photo that loaded properly! I for some reason can't find a photo path that loads correctly, but I've just inspected the photo in my browser to copy the text used by google chrome and stole their source link but literally even that didn't work so I don't know how to get this picture working. I've tried everything. OMG!!! I took out the quotations after src and it worked!! It was disrupting the full URL link I guess, so once I took those out it worked! 

TL;DR:
Branches are very difficult when relying on other people to work on such a small project, because it's not very different than just waiting for the person to push main. 90% of our time was just figuring out the merge requests!
